This website is a repository of collective knowledge, tips and tricks on how to use Great Lakes effectively for your research.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## What is Great Lakes?
The Great Lakes Slurm cluster is a computing cluster maintained by Advanced Research Computing (ARC), a division of Information and Technology Services (ITS) of the University of Michigan. This is the main computing resource you will be using for your research at the University of Michigan.

ARC already has a great [documentation](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/) on how to use Great Lakes. As a result, the purpose of this documentation is not to cover the basics on how to get set up and use Great Lakes. Rather, it is a repository of collective knowledge, tips and tricks on how to use Great Lakes effectively for your research.

## Getting started
You need to create an account by submitting a request to ARC. Make sure you're added to the correct root account! Detailed steps on how to do this can be found in the [user guide](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/user-guide/) maintained by ARC.
