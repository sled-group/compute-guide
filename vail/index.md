# Guide to Using Aspen

To access (on UMich VPN or campus Wi-Fi):
```
ssh <uniquname>@sled-vail.eecs.umich.edu
```
Or, if you are off-campus and don't want to use VPN, you can also do:
```
ssh -J <uniqname>@login.itd.umich.edu <uniquname>@sled-vail.eecs.umich.edu
```


Vail is a lab-owned server sitting in DCO server office. It has the similar hardware as Aspen.

The intention of this compute is to help with tasks that is not doable on Great Lakes such as:
- Machine learning development
- Deadline-sensitive tasks
