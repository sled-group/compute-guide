# `/home`

`/home` comes second in terms of speed, but your data won't be purged like `/scratch`. It's a great option for your code and other development artifacts like pip or conda caches, which are stored in your `/home` directory by default. Please note that you get 80GB. Your home directory can be accessed on a Great Lakes node at `/home/<uniqname>`.
