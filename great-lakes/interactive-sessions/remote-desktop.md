# Remote Desktop

Most likely, you won't need more than [JupyterLab](jupyterlab.md). But if you do need a full-on desktop (maybe for some heavy-duty software you need to run), it's super easy to spin one up. You can launch a single desktop, or even a cluster!

## How to launch it
Go to the [Great Lakes web interface](https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu/) and navigate to "My Interactive Sessions". You'll see something like below.

Use `Basic Desktop` to launch a single machine. Use `Multinode/MPI Desktop` to launch a cluster. If you want more options, you can use `Advanced Desktop`. All the configuration options are pretty self-explanatory. Simply scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the launch button.
