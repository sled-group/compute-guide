# Turbo Research Storage

[Turbo](https://arc.umich.edu/turbo/turbo-user-guide/) is a high-capacity, reliable, secure, and fast storage solution. Different from scratch, files on Turbo will not be periodically erased. It is therefore the reccommended way to store long-term files.

You can check our usage of it on [Resource Management Portal](https://portal.arc.umich.edu/project/chaijy/great-lakes/root-account-detail/chaijy_root).

## Use it on GreatLakes

You can access our volume at

```bash
cd /nfs/turbo/coe-chaijy
```

## Access it Locally

You can also mount the Turbo volume on your personal desktop. The detailed instructions can be found [here](https://arc.umich.edu/turbo/turbo-user-guide/#document-2).
