# Scratch Storage

Scratch is recommended to store **temporal files** and the unused ones will be periodically erased.

Our live usage of it can be found at [Resource Management Portal](https://portal.arc.umich.edu/project/chaijy/great-lakes/root-account-detail/chaijy_root).

You can access our volume at

```bash
cd /gpfs/accounts/chaijy_root/chaijy1/
```
