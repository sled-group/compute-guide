# JupyterLab

JupyterLab a new web-based interactive development environment from Jupyter. It is a more feature complete IDE than the Jupyter Notebook that comes with the ability to use multiple terminals, file managers and Jupyter Notebooks. You can launch this with a click of a button, so it's usually the best place to start.

## How to launch it
Go to the [Great Lakes web interface](https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu/) and navigate to "My Interactive Sessions". You'll see something like below.

All the configuration options are pretty self-explanatory, but one option that needs care is the Slurm account. Interactive sessions are supposed to be short and mainly for debugging. So, instead of using our paid accounts, it's a good idea to use a free account provided by ARC called `engin1`. It's shared across the whole College of Engineering, so technically you may need to wait for your JupyterLab to launch, but usually there's no wait.
