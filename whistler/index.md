# Guide to Using Whistler

Whistler is a lab-owned server sitting in BBB 2912. The intention of this compute is to help with tasks that is not doable on Great Lakes such as:
- Interactive rendering that requires a physical display
- Programs that have special dependencies which cannot be installed on Great Lakes

For these reasons, all users are given `sudo` access on Whistler. With great `sudo` power comes great responsibility.
